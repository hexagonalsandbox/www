- hexagonal sandbox, how modular architecture works in real life with examples

"Play and Design: Modular Architecture for Beginners" that book introduce young people and teenagers to the concept of hypermodular architecture. 
The book is accessible to those who are new to the subject, 
With hexagonal sandbox learning about architecture can be interactive and enjoyable.

Hexagonal Sandbox is a book about hypermodular architecture for a younger audience, I would suggest looking for educational materials that are tailored to introducing architectural concepts to youth. These resources may include interactive websites, educational programs, or children's books that focus on the principles of modular design, sustainability, and innovation in architecture.

A book focus on the hexagonal packing system which is a frequently used geometric approach in modular building design due to its efficiency and strength. 
It could use the metaphor of a sandbox to signify a space for experimentation, learning, and creative thinking about building and design.

The book include:

1. Basic architectural concepts and vocabulary appropriate for the target age group.
2. Hands-on activities or projects that allow readers to design their modular structures, perhaps using hexagonal units.
3. Examples of real-world applications of hypermodular architecture.
4. Interviews with architects or designers who work with modular systems.
5. Illustrations and diagrams that clearly explain the principles of hypermodular design.
6. Discussions on sustainability and the environmental benefits of modular construction.
7. Encouragement for readers to think about how such designs could be used in their communities or as solutions to global challenges.
